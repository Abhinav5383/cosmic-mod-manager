### How It All Began (We Think)

CRMM began its earliest life-form as a humble **H<sub>2</sub>O** molecule drifting through the primordial soup—just minding its own business, really. Then, for reasons no one fully understands (possibly kangaroos), it ended up in Australia, where it accidentally triggered a minor reality-bending event. Out of that chaos came a single, world-altering thought: "What if mods... but organised?" And just like that, Eatham had the spark that started it all. From there, things got surprisingly straightforward (give or take *a few* server fires and of course some head scratching).

---

CRMM was *actually* created on the **10<sup>th</sup> of March 2024**, born from the idea of creating a central place to share everything made for Cosmic Reach. Inspired by platforms like [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/), we set out to build something cleaner, faster, and tailored to our very own little community. And while we still have a long journey ahead, and some potholes along the way, we’re very proud of how far we’ve already come.

### Our Mission

Our goal is simple:
To **empower creators** and **make content sharing seamless**. From mods and maps to texture packs and shaders, we've given creators a way to share what they make – and users a way to enjoy it, effortlessly.

### Meet the Team

While CRMM is a community-driven effort, here are some of the core people behind it:

* **Abhinav** – *The coder wizard*. He built the backend and frontend of the site. If something needs fixing or building, he's the one who gets it done.
* **Eatham** – *The idea guy*. Helped get CRMM off the ground and was there from the very beginning.
* **Spicylemon** – *The manager, logo designer, and grammar checker (when he remembers)*. Oversees the project and keeps everything running smoothly.
* **Hellscaped (Riley)** – *The Owner of CRM*, the main project we merged with shortly after launching.
* **CaptainDynamite** – Helps with funding the project, been there since the start.
* **Dounford & Arlojay** – Provided general help during CRMM’s early days.
* **CRM** – Our “parent” project and a key part of our roots.

Although lots of folks pitch in now and then – mostly via Discord – the day-to-day work is mainly handled by Spicylemon and Abhinav with a few herbes and spices thrown in by Eatham.

And of course, **huge thanks to FinalForEach**, the creator of *Cosmic Reach*, for building such a unique game and giving us this amazing community to build around.

### How It All Works

We self-host CRMM and use open-source, community-friendly tools:

Self-hosted:
- **Postgresql** (sql database)
- **Meilisearch** (text search provider)
- **Redis** (in-memory cache)
- **Clickhouse DB** for fast and efficient analytics
- **Uptime Kuma** for monitoring

Third party:
- **Cloudflare** (Proxy for backend)
- **Fastly** for content delivery and caching

Everything is designed to be lightweight, privacy-friendly, and run with the modding community in mind.

### Community & Contributions

CRMM is **open-source and community-powered** under the *GNU Affero General Public License*.
Users can help translate the site, suggest features, or (if they're feeling bold) even contribute directly via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CRModders/cosmic-mod-manager). It doesn’t happen often, but when it does, we appreciate it deeply.

Want to get involved?
Join our [CRM Discord](${props.discordInvite}) and say hello. Whether you’re looking to contribute or just hang out with fellow modders, you’re welcome here.

### What’s Next?

It's still the early days here, but big things are upon the horizon. From **moderation tools** to **VirusTotal integration**, improved **project reporting**, and more – we’re always building toward a bigger and better platform.

Thank **YOU** for being a part of the CRMM community, and making all of this possible.
We can’t wait to see what you create ;). Happy Cosmic Reaching!
